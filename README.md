CSE3150 Homework 3 Week3 
STUDENT GPA MANAGER
  Through the given starter code I was able to come up with the instructions so that a GPA manager oculd be created with regard to the C++ skills learned in class.  Such as arrays, pointers, refrences, use of const, memory allocation/ freeing, an dmany more.  
  I was ablle to add students, update their GPAs, print the names of all student, and calculate their gpa avergaes.  
  I used concepts like Pointers though the updateGPA() function.  
  Const correectness through printStudent() and averageGPA(). 
  To modify the size variable in a direct fashion refrences were implemented.  
  The use of static_cast<int>() was able to convert the aveage so that it was in a rounded integer format.
